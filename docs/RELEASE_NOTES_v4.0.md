## 🌟 Major Features

### 1. Symbiotic Intelligence

BuddAI now adapts to your work cycles, stress levels, and coding style. It's no longer just a tool; it's a cognitive extension.

### 2. Modular Architecture

The system has been refactored into specialized organs:

- **Executive:** The brain and coordinator.
- **Logic:** Validation and auto-correction.
- **Memory:** Long-term pattern storage.
- **Server:** Communication interface.

### 3. Forge Theory Integration

Your 8-year physics methodology is now fully encoded.

- **Detection:** Automatically identifies control problems.
- **Application:** Applies exponential smoothing (`current += (target - current) * k`).
- **Tuning:** Interactive selection of `k` values (Aggressive, Balanced, Graceful).

### 4. Robust Fallback System

When confidence is low (<70%), BuddAI automatically:

- Escalates to stronger models (Claude, GPT-4).
- Learns from their solutions.
- Stores new patterns for future use.

### 5. Comprehensive Validation

- **128 Tests** covering all subsystems.
- **Integration Tests** ensuring end-to-end reliability.
- **Validator Suite** enforcing hardware safety and style.
