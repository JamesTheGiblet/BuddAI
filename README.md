🧠 BuddAI: Your Personal AI Exocortex

> "Your mind. Your code. Your AI. Forever."
> 
BuddAI is a digital extension of your consciousness, built by a solo developer for the individual. It is a 100% local AI partner that lives on your secure home hardware and follows you anywhere via Tailscale. It doesn't just "know" code; it knows YOU.
BuddAI is trained on the DNA of your career: your 115+ repositories, your specific READMEs, your internal documentation, and the foundational logic of the 8-year Forge Theory project.
⚡ THE PERFORMANCE: 90% Accuracy, Zero Cloud
Generic AIs fail at complex embedded tasks because they don't know your hardware or your style. BuddAI is different.
 * 90% Out-of-the-Box Accuracy: Specifically tuned for ESP32 and complex robotics logic.
 * 10-Minute Debug Cycle: Code, flash, 10 minutes of refinement with your exocortex, and you are away.
 * Forge Theory Integrated: The AI understands 8 years of motion smoothing, power management, and logic patterns—applying them to your new projects automatically.
🏗️ Stage 2: Hardening the Mind
We are moving beyond simple chat into active cognition.
Current Status: ✅ 125/125 Tests Passed (100% Success Rate).
 * 📚 Smart Reading & Context: BuddAI ingests your 115+ READMEs and technical documentation to provide a 360-degree support system that actually understands why you built what you built.
 * 🎯 Smart Skills: Modular abilities to architect entire systems based on your historical successes.
 * ✅ Smart Validation Rules: Advanced checks that ensure every line of code meets your safety standards and the Forge Theory abstractions.
🛡️ Secure & Ubiquitous: Your Brain, Anywhere
Your data never leaves your sight. BuddAI stays locked on your secure home PC, available on your laptop, tablet, or phone via a private Tailscale mesh.
 * Zero Cloud: No data mining. Your "Digital Twin" stays on your silicon.
 * Persistent Context: Start a thought at your desk, finish it in the workshop. The context follows the user, not the machine.
 * Hardware-Aware: It knows your ESP32-C3 inside and out. It validates your pinouts and power profiles before you even pick up the iron.
💎 The Future: P.DE.I & Cognitive Rights
P.DE.I (Personal Data-driven Exocortex Interface) is the upcoming commercial bridge for BuddAI. It will allow individuals to reclaim their rights over their cognitive patterns.
 * Own Your Skills: Turn your 8-year projects into a portable, licensable asset.
 * Shadow Royalties: When you leave a job, you can license a "Shadow" of your expertise back to the company, earning passive income from your past expertise.
